4 Test Plan and Strategy
4.1 Functional testing

The objective of functional testing is to make sure that the whole software product works
according to the requirements, and no significant errors appear in the application.
Functional testing is the most substantial part of software testing. It involves checking
different aspects of the system. A software product must pass all the planned tests. Only
in this case its quality can be assured.

- Technique:
Execute each use case, use-case flow, or function, using valid and
invalid data, to verify the following:
● The expected results occur when valid data is used.
● The appropriate error or warning messages are displayed when
invalid data is used.
● Each rule is properly applied.

- Entry Criteria: 
● The application construction is completed.
● The test engineers are dedicated.
● Necessary devices, instruments, and other equipment are acquired.
● Test environment is prepared, and the application is released to the
test environment.

- Completion Criteria:
● All the planned tests are performed.
● There are no show-stopping errors.
● All the errors of high priority and severity are fixed.
● The test results are evaluated, discussed and approved.

4.2 Bug report
Bug reports are created in order to provide the development team and the project
managers with exhaustive information about the discovered defects. They must be helpful
in determining causes of the errors and correcting them.
